<strong>Rocketseat - Stage 02 / Desafio 04</strong>

I was supposed to fix semantics and improve accessility of an html and css files provided by Rocketseat.

Using tags such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; instead of creating a buch of divs will most definetely improve the reading and organization of the file.

The original layout was available for reference <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/rkDOHGPwwFtBNqEdHSuQPd/Projeto-02---Explorer?node-id=0-1&t=nnVPBtuTT0bLn0PD-0">here</a>.
